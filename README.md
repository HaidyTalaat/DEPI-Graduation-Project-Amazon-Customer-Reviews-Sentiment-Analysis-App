# DEPI-Graduation-Project-Amazon-Customer-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-App
This project addresses the need for tools that analyze customer feedback. By providing sentiment analysis, businesses gain insights into customer opinions, enabling them to adjust strategies to better meet needs. The app uses machine learning and deep learning models, deployed with Streamlit for real-time analysis.

  # Machine Learning Models:
        -Support Vector Classification (SVC): A powerful model for text classification tasks.
        -Logistic Regression: A popular and efficient model for binary classification problems.
        -Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model well-suited for text data with simple yet effective performance.

 # Deep Learning Model:
        -LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): A deep learning model designed to capture sequential patterns in text data, making it ideal for sentiment analysis tasks.

        -Pipeline: Each model is integrated with a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text into numerical features, which are then used for training and prediction.

# Deployment:

The project is deployed using Streamlit, providing a user-friendly interface where:

    -Users can input their own review text.
    -Select a model (SVC, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or LSTM) to analyze the sentiment.
    -Get instant predictions on whether the review sentiment is positive or negative.
